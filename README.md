Common Pantry
--------------------------------------------------------
Summary
--------------------------------------------------------
Created by the Common Pantry Team/Team 6, we have created an Android application that allows a user to search a specific ingredient with an implemented search bar. In return, the user will get a list of recipes that contain the specified ingredient. The Yummly and Spoonacular APIÕs were used in order to receive results.

A preference page was created and implemented to allow the user to specify the allergies which apply to them. They are then excluded from the search results.  Also implemented, was a cookbook where the user can save recipes for later use.
